## ðŸš€ Progress

### What we've done 
- [x] Generate Synthetic Datasets
- [x] Machine Learning Several Models per Loan Types
- [x] Test models with the randomly generated datasets.

### What Should be the Next Step
- [ ] Test Models with the real Dataset
- [ ] Check the accuracy of the models
- [ ] If Models are inaccurate, WHY?
- [ ] If Models works well, What should we do?




## Missing Files
Because generated datas are way to large, this needs to be download manualy.
